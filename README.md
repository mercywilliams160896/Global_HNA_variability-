# Global_HNA_variability

<h1> Genetic epidemiology of human neutrophil antigen variants suggest significant global variability </h1>

This repository provides the complete overview of the methodolgy adapted in human neutrophil antigen variant analysis along with the corresponding datafiles used in the study

The study involved a systematic compilation of HNA variants that are approved by Internation Society of Blood Transfusion - Granulocyte Working Party (ISBT-GWP) as well as those extensively curated from various literature sources. Global frequencies of the compiled list of variants were retrieved from major population scale datasets including the 1000 genomes project and gnomAD. Distinct differences or siumilarities of variant frequencies among various global subpopulations were checked and their statistical significance was estimated using Fishers exact test
